# API_homework

This homework assignment required the creation of a function to judge the theoretical savings of credit union members in light of their portfolio, made up of crypto assets and stocks/bonds, and a statutory emergency fund requirement. We were also tasked with running a number of simulations to demonstrate the potential future growth of the portfolio over the next 5, 10 or 30 years.

The working code and in depth analysis of each of these scenarios can be found in the 'financial-planner' JuyperLab file.
